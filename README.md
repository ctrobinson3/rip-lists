<h3>Why make Rip Lists?</h3>
<br>
Diving is a very niche sport, and when it comes to niche things, it can be hard to find programs to make your life easier. When a diver competes, there are a couple different events they could be competing in and for any of those events, they have rules for what dives you compete or how many you are able to do. At each meet, you are expected to have a dive card for every diver, showing the dives they plan to compete with their information such as direction, number of spins, degree of difficulty, etc. It can get burdensome to hand write dive cards, especially for 11 dive meets when there's a lot of rules associated with that type of meet. Rip Lists is a way for divers or coaches to create and download dive cards for meets and have the peace of mind knowing everything is entered correctly.
